# MW_pulsar_detection

The notebookes used in this repository are made to create ellipses that can be trained with various deep learning modules such as Tensorflow and Yolo_v4 in the hopes of eventually training an algorithm to detect pulsar sources from gamma ray maps of the Milky Way made by the Fermi Large Area Telescope.

Note: The notebook YOLOv4_Ellipse_Training.ipynb was derived from a github repository from The AI Guy which was used to train members on this project on how to use Yolo_v4 with Darknet. The link to the AI Guy's Github repository we used can be found at https://github.com/theAIGuysCode.
